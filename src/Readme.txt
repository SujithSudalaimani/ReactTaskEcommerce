Features:

Fetch Products:
Product data is fetched from the FakeStore API.

Display Products:
Products are displayed inside stylish cards using TailwindCSS.
I have used Ecommerce Product List UI Blocks from the official TailwindCSS documentation.

Add to Cart:
Users can add their desired products to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

Cart Functionality:

A Navbar is created using DaisyUI components.

A Cart Icon is displayed at the top; clicking it shows:

List of products added to the cart

Total number of items

Total cart value

Users can remove unwanted items from the cart easily.

User Info:
Clicking the User Icon displays the username.






Tech Stack Needed:

React.js

TailwindCSS

DaisyUI

Axios (for API calls)

FakeStore API (for sample product data)
